# omniDRAGON

omniDRAGON is a cross-chain deflationary token built on LayerZero OFTV2 that implements a "swap-to-win" lottery system funded by 10% fees on DEX trades (0% on transfers/bridging), using Chainlink VRF v2.5 for provably fair cross-chain randomness and multi-source price oracles with lzRead for accurate valuation. The project integrates Peapods Finance yield strategies for jackpot optimization and ve(3,3)-style epoch-based revenue distribution, creating a gamified trading ecosystem where every swap contributes to and can win from growing cross-chain jackpot pools. This incentivizes active trading participation across multiple blockchains while maintaining deflationary tokenomics through systematic token burning and incentivized locking mechanisms.
